sort expansion spots by value
for each expansion spot:
	if adjacent friendly unit is claimed:
	continue
	bfs for total strength
	if strength ever exceeds strength of target:
		assign all the mission to move to it
	if strength never exceeds target after max depth:
		skip them or intentionally tell them to wait?
