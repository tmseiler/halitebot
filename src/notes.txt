way too aggressive on most maps -- in general strength spent in line waiting to attack is waste if there are good expansions
survey nearby area when expanding -- be less picky if everything is very low strength or high prod?
remove min strength check for expansion
create mission enum and class, determineMission(Location) method
poor scaling with number of 200+ units because they unconditionally A* to a frontier
	have them bfs enemy?
move things to nearest boundary more often
